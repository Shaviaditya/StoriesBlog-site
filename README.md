This is an Storyblogsite which was developed while I was trying to understand NodeJS and its libraries and understand how to implement user authentication using Google Oauth20 passport JS libraries and Express handlebar Libraries. 

## Requirements
Nodejs
ExpressJS
Express-handlebars

## Install
Just download the Repo,and see the steps under **First-things-to-Do**.

**Note**
Node_modules is not included, you need to get it yourself by following the steps under **First-things-to-Do**.

## Requirements
- You require a browser,and a working terminal.
- Node.js should be installed.
    -There are many resources, from which you can learn how to install Node.js

## First-things-to-Do
After downloading the Repo, and having everything of the **Requirements** follow the following steps:
- Get node_modules folder by running the following command
```sh
npm install
```
You will see that, now there is a folder called node_modules,which contains all the dependancies this project requires.
- Then run the following command to get started with project
```sh
node app.js
```
